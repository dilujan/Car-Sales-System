# Car-Sales-System
 computerized system for car sales using Python
Cars are registered electronically, and their details will be kept in a text-file/sqlite database. The system
will store the model and manufacturer of a car. Many cars have the same model (for example 911,
Boxster) and many models are made by the same manufacturer (for example Porsche, Ford). Various
accessories to upgrade a car are also stored in the database.
The office staff will be able to do the following:
  • Add a car manufacturer to the system
  • Add a car model to the system
  • Add a car to the system. Each car has a specified model and manufacturer, plus a colour, a
number of doors (it can be 3 or 5) and a registration number.
  • Add possible upgrades for cars (metallic paint, electric roof window, leather seats, etc). One car
    could have many upgrades. An upgrade can be applied to many different cars
  • Delete a car
  • Search cars by model or/and manufacturer
Each car model has a price and each upgrade has a price. When selling a car, the seller should be able to
select a car for sale and add upgrades. The price should be automatically calculated by the system.
The sale should be recorded against a car with the timestamp and the final amount.
